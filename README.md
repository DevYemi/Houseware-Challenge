A String Duplicate Remover Appllication that was built with React, tailwindCss,WebGL-ThreeJs, and bundled with Vite

## Remarks

- The string duplicate remover is case insensitive
- The app throws an error when the provided string is either empty or contains only space characters.
- The app doesn't throws an error when there is a space inbetween words or letters but the space input is ignored when duplicate of character is being removed

## Note

Based on the intruction in the Original readme file i was under the impression that i should be working in the auto generated Feedback branch which i did.

I later discovered i should have used the gitHub flow and and push all my code to the main branch which i have now done
